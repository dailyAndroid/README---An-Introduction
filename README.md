# README---An-Introduction

Daily Android is a project I started on the 15th of June of 2016. The main objective of this project is to make an Android application every single day for as long as possible. This project is largely inspired by the work of Jennifer Dewalt, where she made 180 websites in 180 days (https://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html). The project started from exploring simple connections from the UI to code, to now, parsing JSON Data to make a fully functional application for example. As I continue to make daily progress, I will add on a sentence illustrating what I've learned from making this application.

Conclusion: 
In hindsight, this project was probably by far the hardest project I had to complete. It taught me so much about persisting and achieving a goal that I've set for myself. There were days where I am pressured by the bugs that I couldn't fix and as a result, caused me to worry how I am going to complete tomorrow's app. But, regardless of the obstacles I've ran into, all the hard work was worth it when the process of developing Android applications became clear to me at the end of the project. I feel an immense sense of proudness that could not be replaced by anything else. 

This project will offer me a good start to the other projects I will embark on later in my career! :) 

Thank you for visiting me this project!
